My research intersects second language acquisition (SLA), natural language processing (NLP), and artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on the evolving role of digital technology in language education. Over the past 7 years, my work has primarily revolved around Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL), covering areas like Game-Based Language Learning (GBLL), corpus studies, automated essay evaluation, and computer-based testing.

I categorize my CALL research into two streams: responsive and inventive CALL. In responsive CALL, I evaluate and apply emerging technologies in language learning, with significant work in GBLL and automated content scoring using NLP tools. I also investigate online learning technologies like live transcripts and metaverse applications in synchronous environments. In inventive CALL, my focus is on creating tools that address real-world needs identified through teaching. Key projects include developing a web-based vocabulary application supporting autonomous learning, integrating gamification features, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated quiz generation. Additionally, I'm collaborating on fine-tuning an automatic grammar error detection model for Japanese learners, aiming to improve its accuracy and adaptability to specific learner challenges.
