In this game, players create and control virtual characters, known as “Sims,” by managing their needs, desires, relationships, and careers. Players can design their homes, guide Sims through different life stages, and create stories through a wide variety of interactions, including socializing, working, and skill-building. Expansion packs introduce additional content, allowing players to explore various themes such as seasons, holidays, and hobbies.</p> <h4 id="potential-for-language-learning">Potential for Language Learning</h4> <p>The Sims 4 offers an excellent opportunity for language learners to engage with practical, everyday English. The game provides numerous opportunities to practice vocabulary related to daily life, such as food, home, work, relationships, and social interactions.

Players can construct various types of educational institutions, from standard lecture halls to quirky establishments like schools for knights. The game is filled with humor and creativity, allowing players to customize campus layouts, hire staff, and provide facilities to enhance the learning experience for students.</p> <p>In Two Point Campus, players are responsible for the overall success of the campus, which involves balancing finances, staff happiness, student grades, and campus aesthetics. The game offers a range of challenges that simulate real-life university administration scenarios, making strategic planning crucial for success. The game encourages players to think critically and solve problems in a timely manner, from hiring the right teachers to dealing with campus disasters such as student protests or knight battles.</p> <h4 id="potential-for-language-learning-1">Potential for Language Learning</h4> <p>While the game is less text-heavy compared to other simulation games, it offers notable educational value for English learners. Players receive input in the form of mission briefings, character dialogues (in text form), and pop-up notifications, which are mainly presented in simple, clear language. Text interactions are triggered through administrative actions or student needs, and these short texts provide practical vocabulary related to school life, management, and construction.</p> <h4 id="suggested-learning-activities-1">Suggested Learning Activities</h4> <p>Students can use Two Point Campus to practice task-based learning by simulating university administration. Each group of students could take on roles (e.g., administrators, teachers, students) and discuss the decisions they make regarding the management of the campus. After each gameplay session, students will write reports detailing the challenges they encountered and the vocabulary related to academic administration. These reports can then be shared with the class, fostering peer-to-peer learning.</p> <h4 id="overall-ratings-1">Overall Ratings</h4> <ul> <li>Game Difficulty: 3</li> <li>Engagement: 7</li> <li>Text Genre: School, Construction</li> <li>Text Volume: 5</li> <li>Vocabulary Difficulty: 5</li> <li>Listening Input: None</li> <li>Helpfulness for English Learning: 7</li> </ul> <hr> <h3 id="project-highrise"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/423580/Project_Highrise/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Project Highrise</a></h3> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-md-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/games/project-highrise-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/games/project-highrise-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/games/project-highrise-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/games/project-highrise.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Project Highrise is a management simulation game that allows players to build and manage towering skyscrapers, offering a combination of architecture, design, and business strategy. As the player, you take control of designing the layout, balancing tenants’ needs, and ensuring the skyscraper remains profitable. The game’s detailed simulation involves managing utilities like electricity, water, and phone lines, and balancing the requirements of residential, commercial, and office spaces, which makes the gameplay highly engaging for fans of management sims.</p> <p>In terms of language learning, Project Highrise offers a text-rich environment, with players frequently interacting with detailed reports, notifications, and tenant feedback. These texts range from short instructions to more complex reports, offering learners exposure to a variety of real-world business and architectural vocabulary. The focus is on reading, as there is no spoken dialogue in the game, making it useful for those looking to expand their understanding of management and construction-related English.</p> <h4 id="potential-for-language-learning-2">Potential for Language Learning</h4> <p>This game is excellent for learners interested in vocabulary related to business, real estate, and urban planning. Players constantly receive feedback on their decisions, and this text-driven interaction helps reinforce language acquisition. The complexity of the text can also be adjusted depending on the player’s pace and decision-making, allowing learners to practice reading comprehension in a non-pressured environment.</p> <p>However, the heavy emphasis on micromanagement can sometimes detract from the overall learning experience, as the game demands careful attention to minor details like tenant happiness and service provision, which might not always be directly related to language learning.</p> <h4 id="overall-ratings-2">Overall Ratings</h4> <ul> <li>Game Difficulty: 5</li> <li>Engagement: 7</li> <li>Text Genre: Architecture, Business</li> <li>Text Volume: 5</li> <li>Vocabulary Difficulty: 6</li> <li>Listening Input: None</li> <li>Helpfulness for English Learning: 7</li> </ul> <hr> <h3 id="detroit-become-human"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222140/Detroit_Become_Human/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Detroit: Become Human</a></h3> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-md-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/games/detroit-become-human-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/games/detroit-become-human-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/games/detroit-become-human-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/games/detroit-become-human.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Detroit: Become Human is an interactive narrative adventure game developed by Quantic Dream.
