## What is {{ page.title }}

In May 2025, the PI led a team in developing **WrAFT** (Writing Assessment and Feedback Tool), a modular
LLM-powered AWE system. The system includes a fine-tuned scoring model trained on proprietary ETS
datasets, a surface-level feedback module in the form of grammatical and mechanical corrections and a deep-level
feedback module on higher-order thinking. 

Significance: WrAFT represents the world's first publicly available AWE system providing ETS-benchmarked
scoring and comprehensive feedback through an interactive UI for argumentative writing. The scoring module
shows superior performance with a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.84 in agreement with ETS rater
scores, significantly exceeding ETS's own QWK threshold of 0.7 for their commercial system Criterion.

### User Input Page

A user can input the essay prompt and their writing (either by uploading a Word document or pasting text directly) in the interface. A list of recent evaluations is shown on the right sidebar. The sample essay in the screenshot is sourced from a Chinese university student, independent from the TOEFL writing dataset used in this study.

### Surface-Level Feedback Page â€“ Track Changes

<img src="/assets/img/awe/surface-level screenshot.png" alt="Surface-Level Feedback Screenshot" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1000px;">

The surface-level feedback can be displayed in three modes; the figure shows the track changes mode, displaying each edit operation. The short explanation shown when the mouse hovers upon a certain edit is an idea for future work not included in the present study.

### Deep-Level Feedback Page

<img src="/assets/img/awe/deep-level screenshot.png" alt="Deep-Level Feedback Screenshot" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1000px;">

The deep-level feedback page displays feedback comments for each paragraph on the left sidebar and micro feedback on the right sidebar when the mouse hovers over a specific text element. Highlights in different colors represent multiple traits of feedback. The page also shows a tab for "Revised Essay" (LLM-revised essay based on deep-level feedback), which is a new feature under development not included in the present work.
