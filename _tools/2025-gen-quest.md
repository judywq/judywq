## What is {{ page.title }}

GenQuest is a text-adventure game powered by LLMs for learner
engagement in reading and contextualized vocabulary acquisition. It features user-driven narrative branching
and in-context word/phrase lookup. The system architecture utilizes LangGraph for plot management and
branching narrative logic, and a small-scale experiment with 20 students has recently been completed.
